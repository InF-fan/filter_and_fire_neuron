## Multiple Synaptic Contacts combined with Dendritic Filtering enhance Spatio-Temporal Pattern Recognition capabilities of Single Neurons

**Abstract**: *A mammalian cortical pyramidal neuron typically makes multiple synaptic contacts on the dendrites of
each of its post-synaptic target neurons. The functional implications of this apparent redundancy are
unclear. Due to dendritic cable filtering, the time-course of the somatic post-synaptic potential (PSP)
depends on the dendritic location of the synaptic contact. With multiple contacts per axon, the
combined PSP due to a single pre-synaptic axonal spike is composed of several different temporal
profiles. We show that this equips the neuron with enhanced memory capacity, increased temporal
decoding capabilities and can serve to reduce axonal wiring requirements. Specifically, our &quot;filter-and-
fire&quot; neuron (F&amp;F) displays up to a threefold increase in memory capacity when challenged with
emitting precisely timed output spikes for specific input patterns, as compared to a leaky integrate-and-
fire neuron (I&amp;F). Furthermore, the F&amp;F neuron can learn to recognize spatio-temporal input patterns,
e.g., MNIST digits, while the I&amp;F model fails completely on the same task. Multiple synaptic contacts
are therefore a potentially important feature rather than a bug.*
